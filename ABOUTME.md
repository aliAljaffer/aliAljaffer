# About me 
Hello! My name is Ali Aljaffer. I'm a Computer Science freshman @ Wright State University. Recently relocated to Dayton, OH.

## Interests
I'm interested in many fields. I love learning about pretty much anything. Well, except for Biology and Chemistry. 
Specific interests include:
  * mathematics
  * gaming
  * custom PC building
  * photography
    - The formats I shoot in are: 
      * 8mm movie(Canon 514XL-S)
      * 35mm(Canon AE-1P, Olympus 500D)
      * Digital(Sony a6000, (and soon) Fujifilm X-S10)
      * Currently trying to snag a 6x9 medium format camera!
    - Here is my [photo portfolio](https://flic.kr/ps/3QcTa1) of non-professional work.
  * doing homework, I guess.
